# Improv502
## This site is for my Code Louisville Front End Dev project
## My aim is to create a site for my local improv team as a one stop shop for shows and events.
In this project I used alot of CSS to create a fun looking page. 
I used JS to create a rule for the event flyer, that when clicked it will take you to the event page.
Used a mixture of CSS & JS to make a contact page for anyone looking to contact the team. 
The hamburger button that appears in Mobile first would not close out when you selected an area to go to, with some JS I was able to get the hamburger menu to close after the area was reached.
Everything should work with a standard PC. Nothing was downloaded outside of googlefonts for this project.
